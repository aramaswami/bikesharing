# Citibike investment opportunity  
NYC has a proven business of ride sharing. Users of the service in NYC demonstrate the prevalence, attractiveness, and utility of ride sharing. We have putr together a stellar team to spread ride sharing in new markets, with Des Moines as our first target market.  

## Analysis summary  
We have crafted a compelling story in Tableau to present the opportunity. Our analysis shows:  
- Adoption in NYC
- Demographics of users
- Details of origin and destinations
- Duration of rides
- Efficiecy and capcity utilization
  

## Investment case  
The data and our analysis shows that over 2.3 million rides occurred in just one month in NYC. Over 70 percent of riders have annual subscriptions which indicated a high degree of repeat use. The demographics also suggest that younger populations use the servce more extensively. From a unit economics standpoint, the data suggests high capacity utilization which leads to a faster payback on fixed investment in ride sharing vehicles and infrastructure.  

An aspect that we looked at further is whether this is a model that would work in a smaller city. Our research suggests that smaller cities with high growth rates, tourism potential, and a younger population would be great sites for ride sharing. With these observations in mind, we hae selected Des Moines as an ideal location for our new service.
